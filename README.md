# observiq-otel-collector-k8s

Configuration for instrumenting Kubernetes with the [observIQ OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/observIQ/observiq-otel-collector).

## Support

**Cluster Support**

Most clusters should be supported. The following are tested:

- On Prem / Minikube
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Platform / Exporter Support**

Most exporters should work. Some require additional configuration to
work well (Google Cloud) while others support native OTLP (New Relic).
The following are tested:

- Google Cloud
- New Relic
- OTLP

**Telemetry Types**

Metrics, logs and traces are supported.

**Metrics**

- K8s Metrics: Cluster, node, pod, and container metrics are collected.
- App Metrics: Application specific metrics can be collected as well, see `app/redis` for an example.
- Custom Metrics: If you have applications emitting metrics using an Open Telemetry SDK, they can be sent to the gateway collector at `observiq-gateway:4317` (OTLP GRPC receiver).

**Logs**

Container logs are collected using the node agent.

If you have applications emitting logs using an Open Telemetry SDK, they can be sent to the gateway collector at `observiq-gateway:4317` (OTLP GRPC receiver).

**Traces**

If you have applications emitting traces using an Open Telemetry SDK, they can be sent to the gateway collector at `observiq-gateway:4317` (OTLP GRPC receiver).

## Usage

> :warning: Please reference a tagged release, Do not rely on main branch to be reliable. If implementing this in a production environment, it is strongly recommended that you copy this code to your own deployment repository.

### Prerequisites

- [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator) for handling collector deployment and configuration
- [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for deployment simplicity

### Deploy Collectors

**Installation**


```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml

kustomize build environments/ci | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl apply -f app/redis/redis.yaml
```

**New Relic**

1. Deploy New Relic API Key (insert your api key into the command):
```bash
kubectl create secret generic newrelic-credentials \
    --from-literal=api-key=<api key here>
```

2. Update the override file in `environments/newrelic/agent.yaml`
- Set `K8S_CLUSTER` environment variable to the name of your cluster.

3. Using Kustomize, deploy the New Relic configuration:
```bash
kustomize build environments/newrelic | kubectl apply -f -
```

**OTLP**

The OTLP configuration exposes the entire collector configuration to the user because OTLP is going
to be unique for each environment.

1. Edit `environments/otlp/agent_gateway.yaml` and set the `endpoint` field (**near the top**) to the otlp endpoint you wish to send to. Make any additional changes required to match the OTLP destination you are sending to.

2. Using Kustomize, deploy the New Relic configuration:
```bash
kustomize build environments/otlp | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Application Monitoring

**Redis Example App**

Redis will be our example application for metrics. When deployed, the OpenTelemetry operator will
inject a collector container into each Redis pod, to collect metrics via localhost.

```bash
kubectl apply -f app/redis/redis.yaml
```

Sidecar injection is one method to collect application level metrics. Alternatively, the collector could be deployed
as a single pod Deployment or Statefulset targeting the application's service. This would require the receiver to be
"cluster aware". For example, Prometheus receiver with kubernetes detection (service discovery) or Elasticsearch (capable of collecting whole cluster metrics from a single endpoint).
